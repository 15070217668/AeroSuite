# Todo List
<p>There are a lot of things to do and I wanted to write some of them down just so I don't forget them and so you can see what is planned for the future.</p>
- [ ] Controls
	- [ ] Additional Features & Controls
		- [ ] DoubleNavigationButton
		- [ ] ExpandButton & ExpandPanel (maybe usable with BottomPanel)
		- [ ] SplitButton
		- [ ] DropDownButton
		- [ ] CommandLink
		- [ ] Extended Form with possible Usage on Windows XP and Linux:
			- [ ] Make it use the default Windows Font and Window Background
			- [ ] Glass (maybe with the managed Margins class as the property type)
				- [ ] Method that makes Controls not look bad
				- Maybe we can look at Microsoft's implementation at Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Shell.GlassForm
			- [ ] Client-Area & NonClient-Area resizing
			- [ ] NonClient-Area Painting
		- [ ] Extended NotifyIcon for NotifyIcon-based Applications (especially way to get the location for showing forms like the sound mixer in Windows)
			- [ ] Also add a custom Form for that purpose (with the Flyout LinkArea Panel (maybe with AeroLinkLabel auto support) as a footer)
			- Maybe we could do some nice Visual Studio-Designer-Integration (for example use the Form Designer for the custom Form and let it automatically add the NotifyIcon)
		- [ ] TextBox with embedded Controls (Buttons)
		- [ ] Combination of TreeView and ListView -> Multi-Column-Treeview
		- [ ] Extended TabControl
			- [ ] Tab Dragging
			- [ ] Controls embedded in the Tab Headers (-> Close Button?)
			- [ ] Custom ContextMenues for the Tab Headers
			- [ ] Multiline Tabs (possible by sending a message - no problem here)
			- [ ] Maybe a new Tab-tab or something similar ^^
		- [ ] Hotkey TextBox
		- [ ] Rating Control
		- [ ] Font ComboBox
		- [ ] Color ComboBox
		- [ ] Color Picker

		- [ ] Nice-looking SplitPanel
		- [ ] Taskbar Icon Progress Wrapper & Button Flasher
		- [ ] Hotkey Wrapper
		- [ ] Advanced User-Input Validation
		- [ ] Breadcrumb-like Control
		- [ ] Shell Drag & Drop (have a look at this: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adamroot/archive/2008/02/19/shell-style-drag-and-drop-in-net-wpf-and-winforms.aspx - much complicated COM stuff though)
		- [ ] Info-Panel (like in the Windows 7 File Explorer)
		- [ ] Wizard
		- [ ] Quad-State CheckBox (Unchecked, Checked, Mixed, Excluded)
		- [ ] Clock
		- [ ] Nicely styled ToolStrip renderer (maybe fix some MainMenu & ContextMenu layout bugs & missing features instead)
			- Maybe have a look at http://wyday.com/blog/2009/making-the-menus-in-your-net-app-look-professional/
		- [ ] ListBox drawn with Visual Styles
		- [ ] ListBox with embedded Controls instead of List Items
		- [ ] Some additional Controls for ToolStrips (with the ToolStripControlHost):
			- [ ] ComboBox
			- [ ] TextBox
		- [ ] ComboBox with custom embedded DropDown-Control (for example a ColorPicker)
		- [ ] The new FolderBrowserDialog that looks more like the OpenFileDialog -> Support for CommonFileDialogs
		- [ ] Support for something like the StockIcon-functionality in the WindowsAPICodePack (Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Shell.StockIcon)
			- Maybe I have been using a similar method in my ImageExtractor class but I'm not sure as I have not looked into it yet
